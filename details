Sampled Audio: 
	Samples: Successive snapshots of a signal (sound-wave in audio)
	Sample Rate: The rate at which an analog signals amplitude is recorded
				 ie: 44100 samples/s or 44.1KHz
	Sample Size: The number of bits per sample
				 ie: 16-bit 
	How it works: The audio is recorded on a microphone, which encodes sound pressure
		into analog electrical signals. An analog-to-digital converter changes
		the signals to samples. 
	Java Library: javax.sound.sampled.spi
